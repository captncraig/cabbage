>[!tip] Swift Quiver
>
> *5th level Transmutaion*
> *Casting Time:* 1 bonus
> *Duration:* 1 minute
> *Components:* V, S, M(a quiver containing at least one piece of ammunition)
>
>You transmute your quiver so it produces an endless supply of nonmagical ammunition, which seems to leap into your hand when you reach for it.
>
>On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action to make two attacks with a weapon that uses ammunition from the quiver. Each time you make such a ranged attack, your quiver magically replaces the piece of ammunition you used with a similar piece of nonmagical ammunition. Any pieces of ammunition created by this spell disintegrate when the spell ends. If the quiver leaves your possession, the spell ends.
