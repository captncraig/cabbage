>[!tip] Giant Insect
>
> *4th level Transmutaion*
> *Casting Time:* 1 action
> *Duration:* 10 minute (concentration)
> *Components:* V, S
>
>You transform up to ten centipedes, three spiders, five wasps, or one scorpion within range into giant versions of their natural forms for the duration. A centipede becomes a **giant centipede**, a spider becomes a **giant spider**, a wasp becomes a **giant wasp**, and a scorpion becomes a **giant scorpion**.
>
>Each creature obeys your verbal commands, and in combat, they act on your turn each round. The DM has the statistics for these creatures and resolves their actions and movement.
>
>A creature remains in its giant size for the duration, until it drops to 0 hit points, or until you use an action to dismiss the effect on it.
>
>The DM might allow you to choose different targets. For example, if you transform a bee, its giant version might have the same statistics as a **giant wasp**.
