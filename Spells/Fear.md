>[!tip] Fear
>
> *3rd level Illusion*
> *Casting Time:* 1 action
> *Duration:* 1 minute (concentration)
> *Components:* V, S, M(a white feather or the heart of a hen)
>
>You project a phantasmal image of a creature's worst fears. Each creature in a 30-foot cone must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or drop whatever it is holding and become **frightened** for the duration.
>
>While **frightened** by this spell, a creature must take the **Dash** action and move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have line of sight to you, the creature can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.
