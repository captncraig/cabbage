>You brandish the weapon used in the spell's casting and make a melee attack with it against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack's normal effects, and you can cause green fire to leap from the target to a different creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of it. The second creature takes fire damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.
>
>This spell's damage increases when you reach certain levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra **1d8** fire damage to the target on a hit, and the fire damage to the second creature increases to **1d8** + your spellcasting ability modifier. Both damage rolls increase by **1d8** at 11th level (**2d8** and **2d8**) and 17th level (**3d8** and **3d8**).
