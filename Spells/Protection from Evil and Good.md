>[!tip] Protection from Evil and Good
>
> *1st level Abjuration*
> *Casting Time:* 1 action
> *Duration:* 10 minute
> *Components:* V, S, M(holy water or powdered silver and iron, which the spell consumes)
>
>Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.
>
>The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also can't be **charmed**, **frightened**, or possessed by them. If the target is already **charmed**, **frightened**, or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.
