>
> *2nd level Divination*
> *Casting Time:* 1 minute
> *Duration:* instantaneous
> *Components:* V, S, M(specially marked sticks, bones, or similar tokens worth at least 25 gp)
>
>By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The DM chooses from the following possible omens:
>
>-  Weal, for good results
>
>-  Woe, for bad results
>
>-  Weal and woe, for both good and bad results
>
>-  Nothing, for results that aren't especially good or bad
>
>The spell doesn't take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.
>
>If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25% chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The DM makes this roll in secret.
