>You weave a distracting string of words, causing creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can hear you to make a Wisdom saving throw. Any creature that can't be **charmed** succeeds on this saving throw automatically, and if you or your companions are fighting a creature, it has advantage on the save. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on Wisdom (**Perception**) checks made to perceive any creature other than you until the spell ends or until the target can no longer hear you. The spell ends if you are **incapacitated** or can no longer speak.
