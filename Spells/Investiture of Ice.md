>Until the spell ends, ice rimes your body, and you gain the following benefits:
>
>-  You are immune to cold damage and have resistance to fire damage.
>
>-  You can move across **difficult terrain** created by ice or snow without spending extra movement.
>
>-  The ground in a 10-foot radius around you is icy and is **difficult terrain** for creatures other than you. The radius moves with you.
>
>-  You can use your action to create a 15-foot cone of freezing wind extending from your outstretched hand in a direction you choose. Each creature in the cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes **4d6** cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails its save against this effect has its speed halved until the start of your next turn.
