>[!tip] Maze
>
> *8th level Conjuration*
> *Casting Time:* 1 action
> *Duration:* 10 minute
> *Components:* V, S
>
>You banish a creature that you can see within range into a labyrinthine demiplane. The target remains there for the duration or until it escapes the maze.
>
>The target can use its action to attempt to escape. When it does so, it makes a **20** Intelligence check. If it succeeds, it escapes, and the spell ends (a **minotaur** or **goristro** demon automatically succeeds).
>
>When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or, if that space is occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space.
