>A beam of brilliant light flashes out from your hand in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long line. Each creature in the line must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes **6d8** radiant damage and is **blinded** until your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't **blinded** by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.
>
>You can create a new line of radiance as your action on any turn until the spell ends.
>
>For the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines in your hand. It sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This light is sunlight.
