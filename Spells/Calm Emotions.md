>[!tip] Calm Emotions
>
> *2nd level Enchantment*
> *Casting Time:* 1 action
> *Duration:* 1 minute
> *Components:* V, S
>
>You attempt to suppress strong emotions in a group of people. Each humanoid in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must make a Charisma saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes. If a creature fails its saving throw, choose one of the following two effects.
>
>You can suppress any effect causing a target to be **charmed** or **frightened**. When this spell ends, any suppressed effect resumes, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.
>
>Alternatively, you can make a target indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed. When the spell ends, the creature becomes hostile again, unless the DM rules otherwise.
