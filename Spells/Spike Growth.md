>[!tip] Spike Growth
>
> *2nd level Transmutaion*
> *Casting Time:* 1 action
> *Duration:* 10 minute
> *Components:* V, S, M(seven sharp thorns or seven small twigs, each sharpened to a point)
>
>The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes **difficult terrain** for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes **2d4** piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.
>
>The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that can't see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a Wisdom (**Perception**) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.
