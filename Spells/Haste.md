>[!tip] Haste
>
> *3rd level Transmutaion*
> *Casting Time:* 1 action
> *Duration:* 1 minute
> *Components:* V, S, M(a shaving of licorice root)
>
>Choose a willing creature that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the target's speed is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to AC, it has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the **Attack** (one weapon attack only), **Dash**, **Disengage**, **Hide**, or **Use an Object** action.
>
>When the spell ends, the target can't move or take actions until after its next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over it.
