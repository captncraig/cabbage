>You attempt to charm a creature you can see within range. It must make a Wisdom saving throw, and it does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is **charmed** by you until the spell ends or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. The **charmed** creature is friendly to you. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was **charmed** by you.
