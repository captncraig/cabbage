>You touch one to three pebbles and imbue them with magic. You or someone else can make a ranged spell attack with one of the pebbles by throwing it or hurling it with a **sling**. If thrown, a pebble has a range of 60 feet. If someone else attacks with a pebble, that attacker adds your spellcasting ability modifier, not the attacker's, to the attack roll. On a hit, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to **1d6** + your spellcasting ability modifier. Whether the attack hits or misses, the spell then ends on the stone.
>
>If you cast this spell again, the spell ends on any pebbles still affected by your previous casting.
