>You point at a location within range, and a glowing 1-foot-diameter ball of emerald acid streaks there and explodes in a 20-foot-radius sphere. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes **10d4** acid damage and another **5d4** acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.
