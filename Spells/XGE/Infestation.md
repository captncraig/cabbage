>[!tip] Infestation

> *Conjuration cantrip*
> *Casting Time:* 1 action
> *Duration:* instantaneous
> *Components:* V, S, M(a living flea)
>
>You cause a cloud of mites, fleas, and other parasites to appear momentarily on one creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or it takes **1d6** poison damage and moves 5 feet in a random direction if it can move and its speed is at least 5 feet. Roll a **d4** for the direction: 1, north; 2, south; 3, east; or 4, west. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks, and if the direction rolled is blocked, the target doesn't move.
>
>The spell's damage increases by **1d6** when you reach 5th level (**2d6**), 11th level (**3d6**), and 17th level (**4d6**).
