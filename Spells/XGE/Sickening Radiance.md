> *Components:* V, S
>
>Dim, greenish light spreads within a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The light spreads around corners, and it lasts until the spell ends.
>
>When a creature moves into the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take **4d10** radiant damage, and it suffers one level of **exhaustion** and emits a dim, greenish light in a 5-foot radius. This light makes it impossible for the creature to benefit from being **invisible**. The light and any levels of **exhaustion** caused by this spell go away when the spell ends.
