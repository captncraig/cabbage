>[!tip] Chaos Bolt
>
> *1st level Evocation*
> *Casting Time:* 1 action
> *Duration:* instantaneous
> *Components:* V, S
>
>You hurl an undulating, warbling mass of chaotic energy at one creature in range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes **2d8 + 1d6** damage. Choose one of the **d8**s. The number rolled on that die determines the attack's damage type, as shown below.
>
>**Chaos Bolt:**
>
>| **d8** | Damage Type |
>|---|---|
>| Acid |
>| Cold |
>| Fire |
>| Force |
>| Lightning |
>| Poison |
>| Psychic |
>| Thunder |
>
>If you roll the same number on both **d8**s, the chaotic energy leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice within 30 feet of it. Make a new attack roll against the new target, and make a new damage roll, which could cause the chaotic energy to leap again.
>
>A creature can be targeted only once by each casting of this spell.
>
>**At Higher Levels:**
>
>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, each target takes **2d8 + 1d6** extra damage of the type rolled for each slot level above 1st.
