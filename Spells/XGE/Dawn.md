>The light of dawn shines down on a location you specify within range. Until the spell ends, a 30-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder of bright light glimmers there. This light is sunlight.
>
>When the cylinder appears, each creature in it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking **4d10** radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw whenever it ends its turn in the cylinder.
>
>If you're within 60 feet of the cylinder, you can move it up to 60 feet as a bonus action on your turn.
