>You create a floating, spectral weapon within range that lasts for the duration or until you cast this spell again.

>
>The weapon can take whatever form you choose. Clerics of deities who are associated with a particular weapon (as St. Cuthbert is known for his mace and Thor for his hammer) make this spell's effect resemble that weapon.
