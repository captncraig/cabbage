>[!tip] Magic Circle
>
> *3rd level Abjuration*
> *Casting Time:* 1 minute
> *Duration:* 1 hour
> *Components:* V, S, M(holy water or powdered silver and iron worth at least 100 gp, which the spell consumes)
>
>You create a 10-foot-radius, 20-foot-tall cylinder of magical energy centered on a point on the ground that you can see within range. Glowing runes appear wherever the cylinder intersects with the floor or other surface.
>
>Choose one or more of the following types of creatures: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. The circle affects a creature of the chosen type in the following ways:
>
>-  The creature can't willingly enter the cylinder by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw.
>
>-  The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets within the cylinder.
>
>-  Targets within the cylinder can't be **charmed**, **frightened**, or possessed by the creature.
>
>When you cast this spell, you can elect to cause its magic to operate in the reverse direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from leaving the cylinder and protecting targets outside it.
>
>**At Higher Levels:**
>
>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration increases by 1 hour for each slot level above 3rd.
