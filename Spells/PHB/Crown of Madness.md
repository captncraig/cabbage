>[!tip] Crown of Madness
>
> *2nd level Enchantment*
> *Casting Time:* 1 action
> *Duration:* 1 minute (concentration)
> *Components:* V, S
>
>One humanoid of your choice that you can see within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become **charmed** by you for the duration. While the target is **charmed** in this way, a twisted crown of jagged iron appears on its head, and a madness glows in its eyes.
>
>The **charmed** target must use its action before moving on each of its turns to make a melee attack against a creature other than itself that you mentally choose. The target can act normally on its turn if you choose no creature or if none are within its reach.
>
>On your subsequent turns, you must use your action to maintain control over the target, or the spell ends. Also, the target can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the spell ends.
