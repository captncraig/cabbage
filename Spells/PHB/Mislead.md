>You become **invisible** at the same time that an illusory double of you appears where you are standing. The double lasts for the duration, but the invisibility ends if you attack or cast a spell.
>
>You can use your action to move your illusory double up to twice your speed and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose.
>
>You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were located where it is. On each of your turns as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are **blinded** and **deafened** in regard to your own surroundings.
