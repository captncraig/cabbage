> *5th level Transmutaion*
> *Casting Time:* 1 hour
> *Duration:* instantaneous
> *Components:* V, S, M(rare oils and unguents worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)
>
>You touch a dead humanoid or a piece of a dead humanoid. Provided that the creature has been dead no longer than 10 days, the spell forms a new adult body for it and then calls the soul to enter that body. If the target's soul isn't free or willing to do so, the spell fails.
>
>The magic fashions a new body for the creature to inhabit, which likely causes the creature's race to change. The DM rolls a **d100** and consults the following table to determine what form the creature takes when restored to life, or the DM chooses a form.
