>You strike the ground, creating a burst of divine energy that ripples outward from you. Each creature you choose within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take **5d6** thunder damage, as well as **5d6** radiant or necrotic damage (your choice), and be knocked **prone**. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn't knocked **prone**.
