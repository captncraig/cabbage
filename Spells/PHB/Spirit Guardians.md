>When you cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it. An affected creature's speed is halved in the area, and when the creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes **3d8** radiant damage (if you are good or neutral) or **3d8** necrotic damage (if you are evil). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.
