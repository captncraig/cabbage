>Brilliant sunlight flashes in a 60-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. Each creature in that light must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes **12d6** radiant damage and is **blinded** for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't **blinded** by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.
>
>A creature **blinded** by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer **blinded**.
