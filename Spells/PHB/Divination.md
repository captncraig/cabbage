>[!tip] Divination
>
> *4th level Divination*
> *Casting Time:* 1 action
> *Duration:* instantaneous
> *Components:* V, S, M(incense and a sacrificial offering appropriate to your religion, together worth at least 25 gp, which the spell consumes)
>
>Your magic and an offering put you in contact with a god or a god's servants. You ask a single question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 7 days. The DM offers a truthful reply. The reply might be a short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen.
>
>The spell doesn't take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.
>
>If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25% chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The DM makes this roll in secret.
