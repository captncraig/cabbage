>A wave of healing energy washes over the creature you touch. The target regains all its hit points. If the creature is **charmed**, **frightened**, **paralyzed**, or **stunned**, the condition ends. If the creature is **prone**, it can use its reaction to stand up. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
