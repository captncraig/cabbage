>
>An affected target can't take reactions and must roll a **d10** at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.
>
>**Confusion Behavior:**
>
>| **d10** | Behavior |
>|---|---|
>| The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a **d8** and assign a direction to each die face. The creature doesn't take an action this turn. |
>| The creature doesn't move or take actions this turn. |
>| The creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn. |
>| The creature can act and move normally. |
>
>At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.
>
>**At Higher Levels:**
