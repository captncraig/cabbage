>[!tip] Freedom of Movement
>
> *4th level Abjuration*
> *Casting Time:* 1 action
> *Duration:* 1 hour
> *Components:* V, S, M(a leather strap, bound around the arm or a similar appendage)
>
>You touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target's movement is unaffected by **difficult terrain**, and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the target's speed nor cause the target to be **paralyzed** or **restrained**.
>
>The target can also spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature that has it **grappled**. Finally, being underwater imposes no penalties on the target's movement or attacks.
