>
>-  You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.
>
>-  You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.
>
>-  You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.
>
>-  You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour.
>
>-  You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.
