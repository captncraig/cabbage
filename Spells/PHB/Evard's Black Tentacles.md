>[!tip] Evard's Black Tentacles
>
> *4th level Conjuration*
> *Casting Time:* 1 action
> *Duration:* 1 minute (concentration)
> *Components:* V, S, M(a piece of tentacle from a giant octopus or a giant squid)
>
>Squirming, ebony tentacles fill a 20-foot square on ground that you can see within range. For the duration, these tentacles turn the ground in the area into **difficult terrain**.
>
>When a creature enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take **3d6** bludgeoning damage and be **restrained** by the tentacles until the spell ends. A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already **restrained** by the tentacles takes **3d6** bludgeoning damage.
>
>A creature **restrained** by the tentacles can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.
