>[!tip] Sequester
>
> *7th level Transmutaion*
> *Casting Time:* 1 action
> *Duration:* until dispelled
> *Components:* V, S, M(a powder composed of diamond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire dust worth at least 5,000 gp, which the spell consumes)
>
>By means of this spell, a willing creature or an object can be hidden away, safe from detection for the duration. When you cast the spell and touch the target, it becomes **invisible** and can't be targeted by **divination spells** or perceived through scrying sensors created by divination spells.
>
>If the target is a creature, it falls into a state of suspended animation. Time ceases to flow for it, and it doesn't grow older.
>
>You can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the target. Examples include "after 1,000 years" or "when the **tarrasque** awakens." This spell also ends if the target takes any damage.
