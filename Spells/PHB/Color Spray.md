>
> *1st level Illusion*
> *Casting Time:* 1 action
> *Duration:* 1 round
> *Components:* V, S, M(a pinch of powder or sand that is colored red, yellow, and blue)
>
>A dazzling array of flashing, colored light springs from your hand. Roll **6d10**; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can effect. Creatures in a 15-foot cone originating from you are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring **unconscious** creatures and creatures that can't see).
>
>Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell is **blinded** until the end of your next turn. Subtract each creature's hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature's hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.
>
>**At Higher Levels:**
>
>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional **6d10** for each slot level above 1st.
