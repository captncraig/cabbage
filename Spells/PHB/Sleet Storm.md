>Until the spell ends, freezing rain and sleet fall in a 20-foot-tall cylinder with a 40-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. The area is **Vision and Light**, and exposed flames in the area are doused.

>If a creature starts its turn in the spell's area and is **concentration** on a spell, the creature must make a successful Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or lose **concentration**.
