> *4th level Necromancy*
> *Casting Time:* 1 action
> *Duration:* instantaneous
> *Components:* V, S
>
>Necromantic energy washes over a creature of your choice that you can see within range, draining moisture and vitality from it. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. The target takes **8d8** necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
>
>If you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it.
>
>If you target a nonmagical plant that isn't a creature, such as a tree or shrub, it doesn't make a saving throw, it simply withers and dies.
>
>**At Higher Levels:**
>
>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by **8d8** for each slot level above 4th.
