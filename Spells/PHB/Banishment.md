>[!tip] Banishment
>
> *4th level Abjuration*
> *Casting Time:* 1 action
> *Duration:* 1 minute (concentration)
> *Components:* V, S, M(an item distasteful to the target)
>
>You attempt to send one creature that you can see within range to another plane of existence. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished.
>
>If the target is native to the plane of existence you're on, you banish the target to a harmless demiplane. While there, the target is **incapacitated**. The target remains there until the spell ends, at which point the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.
>
>If the target is native to a different plane of existence than the one you're on, the target is banished with a faint popping noise, returning to its home plane. If the spell ends before 1 minute has passed, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. Otherwise, the target doesn't return.
>
>**At Higher Levels:**
>
>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th.
